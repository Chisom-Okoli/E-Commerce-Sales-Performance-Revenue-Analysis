# E-Commerce-Sales-Performance-Revenue-Analysis
Analyze e-commerce sales data to uncover revenue trends, top-performing product categories, and actionable insights for business growth using SQL and Python.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist** to provide actionable business insights into:
- Revenue Understanding: Identify which months and product categories generate the most revenue.

- Customer Behavior: Determine whether customers are repeat buyers or one-time purchasers, and assess the impact of customer loyalty on revenue.

- Funnel Analysis: Evaluate where customers drop off in the purchase process — from order creation to payment to delivery.

- Actionable Insights: Provide recommendations that management can use to increase revenue, improve retention, and optimize operations.

## Problem statement 
Management needs to understand where revenue is coming from, how customers behave, and where operational bottlenecks exist in the sales funnel, in order to optimize sales strategy and drive growth.
Specifically:
- Which product categories generate the most revenue, and which ones should be prioritized?
- How does revenue trend over time, and are there seasonal patterns to leverage?
- Are customers making repeat purchases, and how can loyalty be improved?
- Where in the purchase funnel (order creation → payment → delivery) are customers dropping off, and how can conversion be improved?

## Tools Used
- MySQL
Used for core data analysis, including joins across multiple tables, aggregations, filtering, and funnel calculations.
- Python
Used to validate SQL outputs, perform additional analysis, and create visualizations.
- pandas
Used for loading, cleaning, and validating SQL query results exported as CSV files.
- matplotlib
Used to visualize revenue trends, product category performance, and funnel drop-offs.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project is the **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist**.
It contains anonymized data about orders, customers, products, payments, and reviews from a Brazilian e-commerce platform.
